### Django

Django is a web framework written using [Python](/wiki/Python) that allows for the design of web applications that generate [HTML](/wiki/HTML) dynamically.

##### Model-View-Controller (MVC)

Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, where the Model represents the data and the business logic, the View displays the data to the user, and the Controller handles user input and manages the flow of data between the Model and the View. In Django, the Controller is handled by the framework itself, leaving you to focus on the Model and the View.

##### Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

Django provides a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that allows you to interact with databases using Python objects. It abstracts away many of the low-level details of working with databases, making it easier to create and manage database-driven web applications.

##### Template System

Django provides a flexible template system that allows you to separate the design and structure of your web pages from the actual code that generates the HTML. This makes it easier to maintain and modify your web application as it grows and evolves over time.

##### Admin Interface

Django provides a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your web application's data from a web-based interface. It automatically generates an interface based on your database schema, making it easy to manage your data without having to write any additional code.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, Django is a powerful web framework that provides a wide range of features and tools for creating database-driven web applications. By following the MVC pattern, using the ORM system, and leveraging the template system and admin interface, you can quickly and easily create robust and scalable web applications with Django.
